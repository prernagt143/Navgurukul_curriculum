    <h3><u>Loops :</u></h3>
    <p>Loops are control structures in programming that allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times, based on a specified condition. They are used to automate repetitive tasks and iterate over collections of data.
    </p>
    <p>There are several types of loops commonly used in programming:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>While Loop: </b>Executes a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true. The condition is checked before each iteration.
        </li>
        <li><b>For Loop:</b> Iterates over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, string, or range) and executes a block of code for each element in the sequence.
        </li>
        <li><b>Nested Loops:</b> Loops can be nested within each other, allowing for more complex iteration patterns.
        </li>
        <li><b>Loop Control Statements: </b>These statements allow you to control the flow of a loop. Common loop control statements include break, continue, and pass.</li>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li><b>break: </b>Terminates the loop prematurely.
            </li>
            <li><b>continue:</b> Skips the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop.
            </li>
            <li><b>pass:</b>Placeholder statement that does nothing. It's often used as a placeholder when a statement is syntactically required but no action is needed.
            </li>
            <p>Loops are essential in programming for tasks like iterating over data structures, processing elements, and implementing algorithms that involve repetition. They provide a way to efficiently handle repetitive tasks without having to manually write the same code over and over again.
            </p>
        </ul>
    </ol>
