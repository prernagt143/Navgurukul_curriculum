    </h1>
    <p style="font-size: 25px; text-align: center;" class="P"><b>Definition:</b>The internet is a global network that connects millions of computers and other devices worldwide, allowing them to communicate and share information with each other. It is essentially a network of networks, consisting of interconnected computers and servers that use standardized communication protocols to exchange data.
    </p>
    <ol style="font-size: 25px;" class="I"><h3 style="font-size:25px
        ">It's Working:</h3>
        <li><b>Devices and Connections:</b> The internet connects various devices such as computers, smartphones, tablets, servers, routers, and more. These devices are connected to each other through various means, including wired connections (such as Ethernet cables) and wireless connections (such as Wi-Fi or cellular networks).
        </li>
        <li><b>Internet Service Providers (ISPs):</b> Internet Service Providers are companies that provide access to the internet to individuals, businesses, and other organizations. They connect their customers to the larger internet infrastructure through various means, such as fiber optic cables, DSL lines, or satellite links.
        </li>
        <li><b>Routing:</b> Data sent over the internet is divided into small units called packets. Each packet contains information about its destination, source, and the data itself. When a device wants to send data to another device on the internet, it breaks the data into packets and sends them out.
        </li>
        <li><b>Network Infrastructure:</b> The internet relies on a complex network infrastructure consisting of routers, switches, and other networking devices. These devices direct the packets of data from their source to their destination using a system called routing. Routers analyze the destination address of each packet and determine the best path for it to take to reach its destination.
        </li>
        <li><b>Protocols:</b> The internet uses various protocols to facilitate communication and data exchange. One of the most important protocols is the Internet Protocol (IP), which provides addressing and routing capabilities. Another critical protocol is the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), which ensures reliable delivery of data between devices.
        </li>
        <li><b>Domain Name System (DNS):</b> DNS is a system that translates human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses, which are used by computers to identify each other on the internet. When you type a domain name into your web browser, DNS servers are responsible for translating that domain name into the corresponding IP address.
        </li>
        <li><b>World Wide Web (WWW): </b>The World Wide Web is an information space on the internet where documents and other resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) and hyperlinked together. Web browsers allow users to access and navigate the web by displaying web pages containing text, images, videos, and other multimedia content.
        </li>
        <p>Overall, the internet works through a combination of hardware infrastructure, networking protocols, and software systems, allowing devices worldwide to communicate and share information with each other.
