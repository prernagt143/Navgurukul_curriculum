        <h1>Understanding Frameworks and Libraries</h1>
        <h4>What’s a Library?
        </h4>
        <p>Think of a Library Like a ToolBox: It’s a collection of code that you can use over and over again.
            Why Use a Library? For reusing code. Imagine you have a favorite hammer in your toolbox. That's like a library - you use it whenever you need it without making a new one each time.
            Example Time! Let’s say you need to check if an email is valid. You could write a long code or use an "email validator" library that has the code ready. It’s like choosing between making a new hammer or using one that's already in your toolbox.</p>
            <h4> What’s a Framework?
                </h4>
                <p>Think of a Framework as a House Blueprint: It gives you a structure to build your software.
                    Framework in Control: Unlike a library, a framework tells you where to add your code. Imagine a blueprint showing where to put walls and doors – you just follow the plan.</p>
                    <h4>Library vs Framework
                    </h4>
                    <p>Who’s the Boss?
                    With a Library, you’re the boss! You decide when to use it.
                    With a Framework, it’s the boss! It tells you where to add your code.
                    Easy Analogy: A library is like tools in your toolbox. A framework is like a house blueprint you fill in.></p>
                    <h4>. Popular Frameworks and Libraries></h4>
                    <p>Frameworks You Might Know:
                        Rails: Super beginner-friendly for Ruby users.
                        Angular: Great for rich, single-page websites.
                        Django: Python lovers use it for web development.
                        Express: Fast and minimal for backend work.
                        React: By Facebook, for awesome user interfaces.
                        jQuery: Old but gold for HTML and animations.
                        Lodash: A productivity booster kit.
                        Redux: Manages state in apps, often used with React
                        </p>
                        <h4> Let's Play a Game!</h4>
                        <p>Match the Role: Can you match these to either a framework or a library?
                            "I provide a specific structure for building your app."
                            "I’m a collection of handy tools you can use in your code."
                            "I decide when your code runs."
                            </p>
                            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                            <p>Remember: Libraries are collections of tools (like a hammer). Frameworks are like blueprints guiding how to build your software.
                                Next Step: Want to practice? Try using a library in your next project or explore a framework’s structure!
