            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">Operators in programming are symbols or keywords that perform operations on one or more operands to produce a result. Depending on the programming language, operators can be categorized into different types based on their functionality. Here are some common types of operators:</p>
        </li>
        <ol><b><li>Arithmetic Operators: </b>These operators perform mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus (remainder).</li>
        <li><b>Comparison Operators:</b> operators compare two values and return a boolean value (True or False) based on the comparison.
        </li>
        <li><b>Logical Operators:</b>These operators are used to perform logical operations such as AND, OR, and NOT.</li>
        <li><b>Assignment Operators: </b>These operators are used to assign values to variables. They include simple assignment (=) as well as compound assignment operators like +=, -=, *=, etc.
        </li>
        <li><b>Bitwise Operators:</b>These operators perform operations on individual bits of binary numbers.
        </li>
        <p>These are just a few examples of operators commonly used in programming. Different programming languages may have additional operators or variations on these types.
        </p>
        <br>
    <p><b>Conditions:</b>
        <p>In programming, conditions refer to statements or expressions that evaluate whether a certain condition is true or false. Based on the result of this evaluation, the program can execute different blocks of code or take different actions.</p>

           <p> Conditional statements are fundamental to controlling the flow of a program's execution. They enable the program to make decisions and perform different actions based on various conditions.
            
            </p>In addition to the basic "if" statement, there are other types of conditional statements such as:</p>
            <p><ol><li><b>if-else:</b> Executes one block of code if the condition is true and another block of code if the condition is false.
            </li>
            <li><b>if-elif-else:</b>Allows for multiple conditions to be checked sequentially, executing different blocks of code based on which condition is true.
            </li>
            <li><b>Nested if statements:</b> Using if statements within other if statements, allowing for more complex decision-making logic.
            </li>
            </ol></p>

            <li><b>Dry run :</b></li>
            <p><i>
                A "dry run" is a term used in computer science and software development to describe the process of manually stepping through a program's code without actually executing it on a computer. It's a way to simulate the program's execution to understand how it works, identify potential issues, and verify its correctness.</i></p>

<p>During a dry run, a developer typically follows the logic of the program line by line, keeping track of the values of variables and the flow of control through conditional statements (such as if-else statements, loops, etc.). The developer may use pen and paper or a text editor to annotate the values of variables and the results of calculations.</p>
<p>
Dry runs can be particularly useful for:
</p>
<p>
<b>Understanding Code: </b>It helps developers gain a deeper understanding of how the code functions and how different parts of the program interact with each other.</p>
<p><b>
Debugging:</b> Dry runs can be used to identify logic errors, incorrect assumptions, or unexpected behavior in the code. By manually tracing the execution of the program, developers can often pinpoint the source of a bug more easily.</p>
<p><b>
Algorithm Design:</b> When designing algorithms, dry runs can help developers visualize and analyze the algorithm's behavior before implementing it in code. This can lead to more efficient and correct implementations.</p>
<p><b>
Code Reviews:</b>During code reviews, dry runs can be used to walk through the logic of a piece of code with other team members, discussing potential improvements or optimizations.
</p>
<p>
Overall, dry runs are a valuable technique in the software development process, helping developers write more robust, efficient, and bug-free code.</p>
