    <p style="margin: 40px;"> dynamic web applcation</p>
    <p style="margin: 60px;"> A dynamic web application (DWA) is a type of website that uses programming languages like  JavaScript to modify the contents of a web page usually based on an user action. It can be created using different computer languages like PHP, Java, or Python. It's not just a simple website that shows information; it can also do things in the background.
        A DWA can be made in two ways: one-page or many pages with links to different parts of the website. Lots of companies use dynamic web applications, and they are really popular in the IT world. More and more businesses are thinking about using this technology
        What is a dynamic web application?
        A dynamic web application is a type of application that can change its content, appearance, and functionality in response to user input, system events, and information. Dynamic web applications may make use of features such as load-time data-driven forms, AJAX, databases, or other services that respond to external event
        Dynamic Web Applications can change their functionality without having to rewrite parts of their codebase. They offer developers an opportunity to create applications that can adapt based on user behavior and other external factors. They are made up of three components: the backend component (the database), client-side components, and frontend components. These pieces work together to enable users to interact with a DWA, which can change over time just like it does in any other dynamic application
        Examples of Dynamic Web Applic
        When you open Instagram or YouTube, you see a different look and content than your friend because these apps are dynamic web applications. They personalize your experience based on who you are. In Instagram, your feed shows posts that match your interests, and on YouTube, you get video recommendations tailored to your preferences. This customization is what makes them dynamic web applications because they adapt to each user's needs and interests.

<p>a.DOM (document object model)</p>

<p style="margin: 40px;">What is DOM? Document Object Model Meaning in JavaScript
    DOM : DOM is the structured representation of the content in the document created by the 
    browser.
    HTML DOM : It is a tree structured representation of the HTML document created by the 
    browser. We can use this HTML DOM tree to change its content by using j
    avascript.
    HTML DOM allows javascript to change documents structure , style and content.
    Let’s understand this with an example.
    Let’s say we have a html code like the below image.
    </p>

Create a div element by using createElement method
Append the div element to the body
Create a class in your CSS file with the background-image property and set its value to the URL of the background image provided and give background-size and height properties to fit the background image.
And give that class name to this div element by using classList method. (you can also give class name directly to the div element in HTML but don’t do it , add it from js only)
Create heading element by createElement
Add color to the heading element by using style.color in js
Center the heading element by using style.textAlign = center
Append the heading element to the div.
Create the pdara element in the same way and append it.
Create another heading “h4” for the “Read Book” , style it and append it.
Create another para by using createElement for that big large text , add styles and append it.
Create a button by using createElement
apply color , apply background color by using style.
To center the button you have to keep it in another div and you have to apply textAlign to that div. (know the reason why the button has not moved to center when we apply center style directly to it.)
Append the button
Create another paragraph for “skip introduction” and apply the style.color to that paragraph element and give underline to it by using paragraph.style.textDecoration = 'underline'
Append the paragraph finally.

<p>Let's say we have an HTML page with no code linked to JavaScript, as shown in the image below.
