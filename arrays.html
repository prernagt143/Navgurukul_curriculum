    <h1><u>Arrays</u></h1>
    <p class="B"><i><u>DEFINITION:</u></i>In programming, an array is a data structure that stores a collection of elements, each identified by an index or key. Arrays are used to store multiple values of the same type under a single name.
    </p>
    <p>There are two main types of arrays:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>One-dimensional Arrays:</b> These arrays store elements in a linear sequence. Each element is accessed by its numerical index, starting from zero.
        </li>
        <li><b>Multi-dimensional Arrays:</b> These arrays store elements in a grid or matrix-like structure, with rows and columns. Elements are accessed using multiple indices.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Arrays can hold elements of any data type, including integers, floats, strings, or even other arrays (creating multi-dimensional arrays). The size of an array (i.e., the number of elements it can hold) is typically fixed when it's created, although some programming languages support dynamic arrays that can resize themselves as needed.
    </p>
    <p>Arrays are commonly used in programming for tasks such as storing and processing lists of data, implementing algorithms like sorting and searching, and representing matrices or other structured data. They provide a convenient and efficient way to work with collections of values.
