    <h2>Computer basic software and Hardware</h2>
        <li>Computer Hardware</li>
            <p>Hardware refers to the physical components of a computer system or electronic device. It includes all the tangible parts that you can see and touch, such as the central processing unit (CPU), memory modules, storage devices (hard drives, solid-state drives), input/output devices (keyboard, mouse, monitor, printer), motherboard, graphics cards, and various other components.</p>
            <p>
                Hardware interacts with software to perform specific functions and tasks. Without hardware, software wouldn't have a platform to run on. It's the foundation upon which software is built and operates.

    <li><b>Computer Software and Operating System:</b></li>
    <p>Computer software refers to a collection of programs, data, and instructions that enable a computer system to perform specific tasks or functions.</p>

        <p><b>System Software:</b>This type of software provides the foundational functions necessary for a computer system to operate. One of the key components of system software is the operating system.</p>
        
        <p><b>Application Software: </b>Application software is designed to perform specific tasks or applications for users. Examples include word processors, web browsers, video games, and accounting software.</p>

    <li>Managing the computer's memory and processes</li>
       <li> Providing a user interface for interaction with the computer</li>
       <li>
        Managing input and output operations
    </li>
    <li>        Facilitating communication between hardware devices and software applications
        Providing security mechanisms to protect data and resources
        Handling file management and storage operations
        </li>
</ul>
