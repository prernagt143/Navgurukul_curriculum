        <h1>Understanding HTTP - The Foundation of Web Communication</h1>
        <h4>What is HTTP?
        </h4>
        <p>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): The protocol that powers website interactions.
            Role in Web Browsing: When you visit a website, HTTP facilitates the communication between your browser (the client) and the website's server.</p>
            <h4>Understanding Networks</h4>
            <p>Networks: Connections between two or more computers, can be wired or wireless.
            World Wide Web: A global network connecting computers across continents.></p>
            <h4>Internet Connectivity
            </h4>
            <p>Submarine Cables: Massive cables under oceans link continents, enabling fast data transfer.></p>
            <h4>HTTP Basics
            </h4>
            <p>Client-Server Model: Your computer (client) requests a webpage, and the server responds.
                HTTP Requests and Responses: Comprise a start line, headers, and a body.
                </p>
                <h4>HTTP Status Codes</h4>
                <p>200: Success - Page loaded correctly.
                404: Not Found - Requested page doesn't exist.
                500: Internal Server Error - Server problem.></p>
                <h4>Stateless Nature of HTTP.</h4>
                <p>Stateless Protocol: Each request and response are independent, with no memory of past interactions.

                Here is a video to explain the above concepts in detail: link
