            <p class="E"><i>A flowchart is like a map that shows the steps of a process or a sequence of actions. It uses different shapes and arrows to illustrate each step and how they connect to each other.</i>
            <p class="G">Imagine you're baking a cake â€“ you'd start with gathering ingredients, then mix them, bake the batter, and finally, enjoy your cake!
            </p>
            <div class="D">
            <ul type="disc">
               <u><b>Similarly, in a flowchart:</b></u>
                
               <li><u><b>Start: </b></u> You begin at a starting point, often represented by a rounded shape or an oval.</li> 
                
                <li><b><u>Actions:</u> </b>Each action or step in the process is represented by a rectangle. For example, "Mix Ingredients" or "Bake Cake."
                </li>
                
                <li><u><b>Decisions:</b></u> Sometimes, you have to make decisions during a process, like "Is the cake done baking?" These are represented by diamonds. Depending on the answer, the flowchart might follow different paths.</li>
                
                <li><u><b>Arrows:</b></u> Arrows show the flow of the process, connecting each step from start to finish. They show the direction the process moves in.</li>
                
                <li><b><u>End:</u></b> Finally, there's an endpoint, usually represented by a rounded shape or oval, indicating that the process has been completed.</li>
                
                <p>Flowcharts are used in many fields, like programming, business, and engineering, to map out processes, troubleshoot problems, and plan projects. They're a great way to visualize complex processes and understand them better.
