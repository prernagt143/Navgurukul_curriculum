                <p style="margin-left: 20px;">An odometer wheel is used to measure forward distance for a piezoelectric
                    ultrasonic device, and it plays a key role in locating defections. Buckling and skidding are its
                    main problems in applications. Based on a self-developed in-line inspection tool, an odometer wheel
                    was designed according to mechanical design principles. A finite element model on scale of 1 : 1 was
                    built to <u  style="color: purple;">simulate mechanical performance of the odometer wheel.</u>   Results show that the maximum Mises
                    stress under the worst condition is far less than the elastic limit of chosen stainless steel, and
                    deformations of swing arms are slight. Acting forces under different conditions also meet
                    requirements of antiskid. It indicates that the designed object has good performance in terms of
                    structure stability and skid prevention.

                <p style="margin-left: 20px;"> An ultrasonic in-line inspection tool is pushed forward by pressure
                    difference between its front and
                    back in oil and gas pipes. As a spring is used in an odometer wheel, <u style="color: purple;">it pulls the swing arm outward
                    so that a roller installed at an end of the swing arm can press tightly against the inner wall of a
                    pipe. </u>A gear that rotates synchronously is set on one side of the roller, and a Hall sensor is used
                    to capture the rotation signal of a gear [14], as shown in Figure 1. After the signal being
                    processed and stored, it is converted into a required odometer signal, and finally we can get the
                    locating data.
